# GD-CSS Decoder (Quantum Error Correction using Non-binary LDPC over GF(q))

This repository provides a C++23 implementation of a **joint / degenerate decoder**  
for CSS codes constructed from non-binary LDPC codes over GF(q).  
It performs iterative BP decoding with cross-channel coupling (C↔D) and  
supports small-error recovery heuristics based on UTCBC structures.

## 🧩 Dependencies

This program depends on the following library:

- **Eigen** ≥ 3.4  
  Header-only C++ template library for linear algebra.  
  It is required for matrix and vector operations used in the decoder.

Eigen is **not bundled** with this repository.  
Please install it before building.

### macOS (Homebrew)
```
brew install eigen
```

### Ubuntu / Debian
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```

After installation, the build script (`scripts/build.sh`) automatically detects  
the installed Eigen path (`/opt/homebrew/include/eigen3`, `/usr/include/eigen3`, etc.),  
so no manual configuration is required.

## ⚙️ Build

To compile the decoder, simply run:
```
scripts/build.sh
```

Or manually:
```
g++-14 -w -std=c++23 src/gd_css_patched.cc -o gd_css -O3 -lm   -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/eigen/3.4.0_1/include/eigen3   -I/usr/local/include/eigen3   -D_Alignof=alignof
```

---

## ▶️ Run Example

```
scripts/run_example.sh
```

Equivalent to:
```
./gd_css 500   data/apm_css/QC_Gamma_J2_L6_P6500_RQ0.333333_alpha1_GF256_GIRTH12_SEED101   data/apm_css/QC_Delta_J2_L6_P6500_RQ0.333333_alpha1_GF256_GIRTH12_SEED101   QC_J2_L6_P6500   0.0640   1   101
```

## 📊 Output

During decoding, the program prints progress information such as iteration count,  
syndrome satisfaction, and error statistics.  
Results are also written to log files in the working directory:

- `LOG_*` → decoding statistics (FER/SER, iterations, etc.)  
- `EF_LOG_*` → detailed debugging information (error-floor analysis)

---

## 📄 Notes

- Ensure that the following directories exist and contain the required data:
  - `data/apm_css/` — contains matrix files for C and D
  - `data/Tables/` — contains GF(q) lookup tables  
    (`BINGF256`, `ADDGF256`, `MULGF256`, `DIVGF256`, `TENSORFFT256`)
- If the `Tables` directory is inside `data/`, create a symlink for runtime:
  ```
  ln -sfn data/Tables Tables
  ```

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

The decoder implementation presented in this work is based on the classical non-binary LDPC decoder originally developed by Prof. David Declercq, Loïc Barnault, and Charly Poulliat when they were members of the ETIS coding group.  
During my stay at ETIS, Charly kindly shared the code with me, and I later extended and adapted it for quantum error correction (QEC) using non-binary LDPC codes.  
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to David, Charly, and the ETIS coding group for their pioneering contributions to non-binary LDPC code design and decoding algorithms, which have provided a solid foundation and lasting inspiration for this research.
